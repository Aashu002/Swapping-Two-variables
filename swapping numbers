# Swapping variables using third variable:

a = 8
b = 10

c = a      #assigning first to third variable
a = b      #now a is empty we will assign b into it 
b = c      #same is done with b and c

print("a = " , a)
print("b = " , b)

# Swapping variables without using third variable:

a = 8
b = 10
a , b = b , a
print("a = " , a)
print("b = " , b)
